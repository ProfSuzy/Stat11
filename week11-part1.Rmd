## Introducing the t-distribution 


**Central Limit Theorem**
If (1) a sample is random and independently drawn from some population and (2) the number of observations $n$ is large (but not more than $10\%$ of the size of the population) then... the sampling distribution of the sample means (or sample proportions) follows a Normal distribution. 


--
More specifically, 

* the sampling distribution of the sample proportions is: $\hat{p} \sim N\left(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n} \right)$ and

* the sampling distribution of the sample means is: $\bar{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right)$.

## Introducing the t-distribution 

The standard error of a sample estimate (such as a mean or proportion) is an approximation to the standard deviation of it's sampling distribution. 

For proportions: $sd(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{obs}(1-\hat{p}_{obs})}{n}} = SE(\hat{p})$

For means: $sd(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}} = SE(\bar{X})$


--
Because there are *two* unknown population parameters in the sampling distribution of the sample means, we have to use the same data set .blue[twice] to estimate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. This implies that we have more uncertainty in the accuracy of estimating the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ with a Normal distribution - especially for smaller sample sizes. 

Former head brewer of Guinness and self-taught data scientist William Sealy Gosset, realized this discrepancy when studying the chemical properties of barley for samples that could be as small as $n=3$.

## Introducing the t-distribution 

In the context of hypothesis tests, recall that for tests about a population proportion, the test statistic is 

$$T.S. = \frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \hspace{.2cm} \widetilde{\tiny H_{0}} \hspace{.2cm} N(0,1).$$ 


For tests about a population mean, the test statistic is similar but instead follows a t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom

$$T.S. = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}} \hspace{.2cm} \widetilde{\tiny H_{0}} \hspace{.2cm} t_{(n-1)}.$$

## Introducing the t-distribution 

In R, the same functions for generating a random sample or calculating a quantile or a probability for a Normal RV exist for a *Student's t* RV. The only difference is that now we need only to specify the *degrees of freedom* parameter rather than the distribution mean and standard deviation. 
```{r}
#rt(n = sample size, df = degrees of freedom parameter)
#qt(p = probability, df = degrees of freedom parameter, lower.tail=TRUE)
#pt(q = quantile, df = degrees of freedom parameter, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

Since the *t-distribution* is similar to the standard Normal distribution (i.e. symmetric, unimodal, centered at zero), the probability and quantile calculations are done in the same manner as they are for Normally distributed RVs. 




---
## When to use the t-distribution or the Normal distribution 

* For inference about proportions, always use the Normal distribution (but make sure you have enough observed "success" and "failures"!).

* For inference about means, if the sample size is large, use the Normal distribution. 

* For inference about means, if the sample size is small, use the t-distribution.

## Group work
### HW 7 Problem 1 

**Instructions:** Spend the next $20$ minutes working with your group to answer the questions on the worksheet for Class 19. 

Use the internet to do a search to help you find your answers. We will go over these answers in class either today or Thursday. 

As I walk around, feel free to ask me questions. I may listen in to your group discussion for a bit to guide your discussions. 

<br> 

<br> 

**Hint:** There may not be any parameters for some of the chi-squared tests!

## Reflection prompt 





When you are finished with the reflection prompt, please take one minute (it seriously won't take any longer) to complete the [survey for Team Java](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScW7vzX9NG6t2mw4TPg93O68F1kJ1nGUBrsA7-wioEzsGZMWQ/viewform) which can be under the Final Project section of our Moodle page.

## Looking ahead 

* Read Chapters 17 and 20 in the 5th edition of your textbook by next class. 

* Homework

  - HW 7 will is due this Friday by 6pm. Start on the problems (besides Problem 1) tonight! 

  - HW 8 will be due over Thanksgiving break. 

  - Your last HW assignment, HW 9, will be different from the others in that you won't be deriving solutions to particular problems, rather you will be constructing a road map for evaluating the quality of a statistical analysis. This HW assignment will be graded entirely for completion and is worth $15$ HW points. (This grading policy for HW 9 is meant to make up for any confusion from earlier HW assignments regarding due dates or typos or other miscommunications on my part.)    



---
## Looking ahead 

* Test 2 

  - Will be graded and handed back on Tuesday, Nov 23.  

  - Corrections are due on Friday, Dec 3rd, the same day that your last HW assignment is due. 
  
  - The second round of grading for half-credit will be complete by the last day of class. 


--
* Final Project 

  - The rough draft of your report is due at the end of the month (Nov 30 for group projects, Nov 24 for individual projects). 

  - The last day of class you will have 5 minutes to present your final project to the class. Bring your poster and assign a person to be the reporter/presenter. The remainder of the class will be time to explore other peoples projects and ask questions about them. Each person will have a questionnaire to fill out for another project to encourage everyone to explore another project and explain their own.
