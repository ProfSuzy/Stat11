# Quiz 1 


## Collect/Gather Data
- consider confounding variables 
- ethical issues for experimental design 
- basics of experimental design (random sampling vs random assignment, blocking, control)


## Describe Data 
- describe distributions in terms of variability and location 
- interpret plots like density curves or histograms, bar charts, boxplots 
- switch perspectives from trend lines to histograms 
- use correlation to describe trends 
- summary stats including means and sample proportions
- standard deviation vs standard error 


## Intro to RVs 

- identify population, parameters
- able to distinguish randomness vs arbitrariness 
- fundamentals of random variables and sample spaces 
- expected value and variance of a random variable 


# Quiz 2 

## Connecting RVs to data 
- probability (and conditional probability) calculations based on contingency tables 
- independence based on contingency tables 
- sampling distributions compared to distributions of population RVs 
- visualize sampling distribution of sample proportion 


## Inference for a single proportion
- how to generate valid CI for proportion 
- identify test statistic and p-value for single population proportion 
- define hypothesis for single proportion 

## Principles of inference more generally 
- different info in tests vs CIs 
- valid vs invalid interpretation of CIs 
- understand type I error rate 
- idea of sampling distribution revisited 


# Quiz 3 

## More methods 
- inference for single mean (especially sampling distribution)
- inference for difference in proportions 
- inference for difference in means 
- chi square procedures 

## Metacognitive 
- comparing one sided tests to two-sided tests 
- interpret test statistics relative to sd of sampling distribution 
- when to use different procedures 
- how to assess reliability of study conclusions 



# Final exam
